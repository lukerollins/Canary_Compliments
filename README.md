# Canary_Compliments
This is my Code Louisville FSJS 2018 project. Type your most interesting compliments in the text area below and press 'Chirp' to post them. 

In order to make this particular site run, you'll need to make sure that npm is installed. In the command line type 'npm start' in the Canary_Compliments-master directory. You'll probably need to run mongodb, too. In your browser, navigate to 'localhost:3000'.

If you want to edit what has been written, click '+cheep edit' and the text will appear in that same text area below. Edit it how you see fit and click 'Chirp' again to save those edits. If you want to remove a compliment, click 'x cheep remove'. 

Inspired by 'Gopher Gripes', a site made by one of the host of the podcast 'Reply All'.
