# Canary_Compliments
This is my Code Louisville FSJS 2018 project. Give the canary your most interesting and/or funny compliments and it'll 'say' them to you. At least, that's my plan. Based off of Gopher Gripes, a site made by one of the hosts of the 'Reply All' podcast.

In order to make this particular site run, you'll need to run npm by running 'npm start' in the Canary_Compliments-master directory. Also you'll need to run mongo in the 'db' directory that resides in the 'data' directory. You'll need to run 'mongod --dbpath 'directory'/'directory'/Canary_Compliments-master/data/db'. In your browser, navigate to 'localhost:3000'.
