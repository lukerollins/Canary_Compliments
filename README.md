# Canary_Compliments

## This is my first installment in the the wonderful world of JavaScript Frameworks.



I chose Handlebars.js becuase, while not a framework per se, it was simple and would do what I wanted. I figured I'd attach it to a Mongo Database because I don't have access to the internet at my apartment. I figured a local database would help me get around this issue. This way I could experiment with a framework without having to worry about access to the web.

In order to make this particular app run, you'll need to make sure that npm, express, body-parser, mongoose, mongodb, and nodemon are installed. Then in the command line type 'npm start' in the Canary_Compliments-master directory. You'll probably need to run mongodb, in whatever manner your operating system requires, as well. In your browser, navigate to 'localhost:3000'.

Type your most interesting compliments in the text area below and press 'Chirp' to post them. If you want to edit what has been written, click '+cheep edit' and the text will appear in that same text area below. Edit it how you see fit and click 'Chirp' again to save those edits. That text will probably remain there. This is a problem I couldn't solve, I'm sad to say. If you want to remove a compliment, click 'x cheep remove'.
