# Canary_Compliments
This is my Code Louisville FSJS 2018 project.  

In order to make this particular app run, you'll need to make sure that npm, express, body-parser, mongoose, mongodb, and nodemon are installed. Then in the command line type 'npm start' in the Canary_Compliments-master directory. You'll probably need to run mongodb, in whatever manner your operating system requires, as well. In your browser, navigate to 'localhost:3000'.

Type your most interesting compliments in the text area below and press 'Chirp' to post them. If you want to edit what has been written, click '+cheep edit' and the text will appear in that same text area below. Edit it how you see fit and click 'Chirp' again to save those edits. That text will probably remain there. This is a problem I couldn't solve, I'm sad to say. If you want to remove a compliment, click 'x cheep remove'. 

Inspired by 'Gopher Gripes', a site made by one of the host of the podcast 'Reply All'.
